# Python-Cybersecurity

#### Description

Welcome to our wonderful GitHub repository , which is intended as a collective Python knowledge base involving Python usage in Cybersecurity!

#### Folder Layout

I thought it would be a good idea to organize Python code in folders. Once you open each folder, you will find a note describing the category!

Once you have navigated to the folder, please click on  the files that match the particular context you are interested in!


#### The Goal :

On our journeys on the path of Cybersecurity, each of us would find some interesting Python code that grabs our attention. I plan to start the journey by going through 
each lab we have done in Offensive Security!
